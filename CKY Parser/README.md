CKY parser 

Steps to execute

I. Execute the Hw2_CKYparser.py program separately for each sentence as following:
	
  python Hw2_CKYparser.py <grammar_filename> <sentence_filename> <output_filename> where:
    
    1. <grammar_filename> is the name of the file holding grammar rules in the in Chomsky Normal Form.
    2. <test_sentence_filename> is the name of the file containing the test sentence/s.
    3. <output_filename> is the name of the file where the parses for the test sentence/s are written.

	python Hw2_CKYparser.py grammar1.txt sentence1.txt output1.txt	Sentence1: grammar1.txt -> CNF Grammar; sentence1.txt -> File with input sentence; output1.txt -> File with output
	
	python Hw2_CKYparser.py grammar2.txt sentence2.txt output2.txt	//Sentence2: grammar2.txt -> CNF Grammar; sentence2.txt -> File with input sentence; output2.txt -> File with output
	
	python Hw2_CKYparser.py grammar3.txt sentence3.txt output3.txt	//Sentence3: grammar3.txt -> CNF Grammar; sentence3.txt -> File with input sentence; output3.txt -> File with output
	
	python Hw2_CKYparser.py grammar4.txt sentence4.txt output4.txt	//Sentence4: grammar4.txt -> CNF Grammar; sentence4.txt -> File with input sentence; output4.txt -> File with output
	
II. output folder consists of already achieved outputs for the sentences using the program.	
	
  1.  1. output1.txt	:	Bracketed Parse for S1
      2. T1.txt		    :	Parse Tree for S1
  
  2.  1. output2.txt	:	Bracketed Parse for S2
      2. T2.txt		    :	Parse Tree for S2
      
  3.  1. output3.txt	:	Bracketed Parse for S3
      2. T3.txt		    :	Parse Tree for S3
  
  4.  1. output4.txt	:	Bracketed Parse for S4
      2. T4.txt		    :	Parse Tree for S4
